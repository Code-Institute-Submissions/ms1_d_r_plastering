D R Plastering Services are a real life business, who conduct Plastering services within the West Midlands, UK. With the absence of a web presence, I saw a great opportunity in creating the business a professional, easy to navigate and functional website to attract potential new clients. The website is designed to primarily to enable its users to easily make contact with the business and to promote the services offered to potential clients.

Project Requirements:
User-Centric Frontend Development - Create a user centric website using front end technologies - HTML5 - CSS3 and supporting libraries such as Bootstrap

A live version of the site is available [here.](https://jamie120.github.io/ms1_d_r_plastering/index.html)

# Structure

## Design Process

#### Page Structure

* I wanted the site to remain simple and easy to navigate, therefore the use of sections were kept to a minimum on each page. Most of the pages remain viewable in full without scrolling when using a desktop device. The reason for this design choice, is to acheive the purpose set out to make the user experience quick and easy to locate the information they require.

* All pages apart from the home page, will adopt a similar page structure with content following a page header - the header will detail to the user which page they are currently viewing. This design choice supports the user experience, make it easier to navigate the site and provides visual feedback to the user.

* A fixed responsive navbar will be at the top of each page - it will contain links to other pages in the website and have a slightly contrasting color to the top section. This navbar will collapse on mobile devices - and justify centrally on the page.

* Further research was conducted to understand how similar businesses present themselves on the internet, this information was used to aid my decisions when deciding the site layout, fonts, colors and general look and feel of the site.

* I began to outline the content requirements for the site based on the research I had conducted and thought about the best way for a user to navigate through this content. Taking this approach I decided on seperate pages for content, linked together through a navbar and various call to action buttons throughout the site. The pages I decided to develop were: Home, Services, Gallery, About, Contact.

* The home page, as a landing page for the site needed to contain clear content highlighting the key areas of the site a user may require. With this in mind, I would nest two buttons within the hero image, addressing the most popular two actions expected to be executed by users.

    1. To view 'services'
    2. To 'get a quote'

* The wireframe was designed using Figma. I started with a single home page design, worked on developing a page structure which would support the requirements of the home page.

#### Home

* The Homepage will feature three areas of content. 

    1. The first section will contain a large photograph relevant the trade services offered, overlayed with the business name and supporting text. 
    It will also contain two call to action buttons. One linking to the services page and the other linking to a pop-up form, enabling the user to request a quote.

    2. The second section will contain clear contact details for the business.

    3. The third section will display testimonials and informing the user of the business services / experience

#### Services

* The Services page will feature three areas of content. 

    1. The first section will contain clear contact details for the business. 

    2. The second section will contain a header - followed by a breakdown of the services offered by the business.

    3. The third section is simply a page break followed by a call to action button guiding the user to - *'GET A QUOTE'*, which will open a pop-up contact form when clicked on by the user.

#### Gallery

* The Gallery page will feature three areas of content.

    1. The first section will contain clear contact details for the business. 

    2. The second section will contain a header - followed by photographs of completed work.

    3. The third section is simply a page break followed by a call to action button guiding the user to - *'GET A QUOTE'*, which will open a pop-up contact form when clicked on by the user.

#### About

* The About page will feature four areas of content.

    1. The first section will contain clear contact details for the business.

    2. The second section will contain a header - followed by a short bio of the business and a supporting image, which compliments the site. 

    3. A short page break will be followed by the third section - containing the company values statements. This will display four key words, elegantly spaced and styled to acheive a bold and confident message to the viewer. 

    4. The fourth section will contain a call to action button for the user to - *'GET A QUOTE'*, which will open a pop-up contact form when clicked on by the user.

#### Contact

* The Contact page will consist of two areas of content. 

    1. The first section will consist of three elements. A section header, a contact information box and a contact form.

## Responsive Design

Once all the wireframes were developed for viewing on a larger desktop sized display. I worked to create seperate wireframes for both tablet and mobile screen sizes. This required me to decide how best the content should be displayed on smaller devices. I ensured to keep the 'user' at the heart of any design choices. Making decisions on content order was important, as less content is viewable on smaller screen sizes without the need to scroll. To ensure engagement was maintained and users are able to find key content quickly, some content was shifted or even removed on smaller screens, using responsive design.


## Changes In Functionality / Design

It was decided that the 'get a quote' form was to be different from the contact us form. As they serve two different purposes.
I have since decided to use a modal for the pop up form (Get a Quote), as opposed to the contact form originally developed using wireframes.

Multiple Testimonials were added to the home page - using a Bootstrap carousel - this will support user confidence in the business, by providing more examples.


# Surface

## Colours

A palette of four colours were chosen for use accross the site. Each color compliments each other and the images used to display purpose to the business. The colours are able to be used to create contrast between each other and continuity between pages.

Color Palette - Three main obvious colors compliment the design of the site. These are displayed below:

- ![#b89f91](https://via.placeholder.com/15/b89f91/000000?text=+) `#b89f91` - Logo & Buttons
- ![#dca518](https://via.placeholder.com/15/dca518/000000?text=+) `#dca518` - Page breaks and footer
- ![#707070](https://via.placeholder.com/15/707070/000000?text=+) `#707070`- Page header

Various other shades of grey are used appropriately, to highlight, surround and drop shadows on elements to support the sign design and ease of navigation.

## Fonts

Roboto was chosen as the font to be used sitewide, due to its clean professional look. It was imported from Google Fonts, I applied the font-family directly to the body, with a fallback font of sans-serif.


# Features

## Nav Bar
* The site uses Bootstrap to create a collapsed navbar on small devices. This enables users to view more relevant content on smaller screens, with the option to expand the navbar if required.

* The navbar and logo banner becomes fixed to the top of all pages if a user scrolls down to see more content on a page.

* Links to social media are fixed to the nav bar - with a hover effect to indicate a user can interact with the icons.

## Get a Quote - Modal Form

* A modal form is viewable upon clicking the 'get a quote' button on any page. The modal form was acheived by using supporting code from the MD Bootstrap library. https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/modals/forms/
* The buttons slightly grow in size when hovered upon. 
* Although not functioning as a form and actually submitting data, for design purposes and to demonstrate the user journey it is linked to a response page.

## Testimonals 

* An automated scrolling testimonal section is displayed on the home page. This is acheived using supporting code from the Bootstrap carousel component. https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/

## About Page
### Google Map Feature

* An embedded Google map on the about page, indicates a fixed area in which the business operates. This is a nice touch to the website and provides the website user with a clear view of the business operating area. This map was embedded using code from the following site: https://www.embedgooglemap.net/en/?gclid=CjwKCAjwmMX4BRAAEiwA-zM4JoyJB_AMMTM8hXyyqUkgRPOhXRWv6NyhWXqxULExeMFMwcGrFYMOzRoCLf0QAvD_BwE
## Future Features

* I would like to add functionality for the business to be able to update their Gallery images themselves, with newly completed projects. This would need to be via an intuitive user friendly approach, with no knowledge of coding and would require other technologies not currently used in this project.

* I would also like to add more functionality to the services page, enabling the user to click the images on the services page to view more images which have been filtered only to display those related to that specific service.

* I also wish to animate the buttons used throughout the site, to provide visual feedback to users when they are interacting with button elements.

# Testing

## Testing User Stories
* **As a visitor to the site, I want to easily be able to navigate the site and engage with the business if desired.**
    * The site is easy to navigate, there are multiple ways to engage with the business easily available to the user.

* **As a visitor to the site, I want to learn more about the services offered and view some of the work previously completed by the business, so that I can establish if what I require is offered.**
    * The services page was easily located, services offerered are clear. Gallery was easily located, photos of completed work is clear to me.

* **As a potential client, I want to leave a message/query but I would rather not call.** 
    * I was able to easily find the contact page, where a form is available for me to use. Alternatively there are 'email' links around the site, which open my mailbox to write an email if desired.

* **As a potential client, I want to easily be able to contact somebody directly - so that I can arrange to recieve a quote.**
    * Upon visiting the site, it was clear that I could request to get a quote very easily. I was able to locate a direct phone number, or I could send a message using a form. Alternatively I could email directly.

* **As a potential client, I want to easily find the contact details of the buisness, as I would rather speak to somebody directly.**
    * On each page I was able to locate a direct phone number with ease.

## Testing responsiveness

- I used Google Developer Tools within Chrome to view the project on responsively on all screen sizes, down to < 300px width.

## Testing different browsers

I manually tested the website on the following web browsers
- Google Chrome 
- Safari
- Mozilla Firefox 

## Validating the HTML and CSS code

All of my code passed the following validation tests:
- HTML: [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
- CSS: [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)


## Issues found

* There were various HTML validation issues to resolve. These mainly reffered to formatting my code and were easily fixable accross the site.

* I found various issues with responsiveness whilst testing across various screen sizes. This led me to change my mediaqueries to be more reactive at smaller screen sizes. Initially i utilized three main breakpoints where most changes would occur to layout and adjustments in font sizes. In the final deployment, I have made more incremental changes to enable a better user experience.

* Due to the site not translating on iPad, I made changes to accomodate a better user experience on devices at this size.

* I had overflow issues when my site was first posted on the peer-code-review forum on the Code Institute Slack community. This was highlighted to me by fellow students. I was able to resolve this issue by making changes to my grid and adjusting various parameters.
