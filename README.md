## Structure

### Design Process

#### Page Structure

I wanted the site to remain simple and easy to navigate, therefore the use of sections were kept to a minimum on each page. Most of the pages remain viewable in full without scrolling when using a desktop device. The reason for this design choice, is to acheive the purpose set out to make the user experience quick and easy to locate the information they require.

All pages apart from the home page, will adopt a similar page structure with content following a page header - the header will detail to the user which page they are currently viewing. This design choice supports the user experience, make it easier to navigate the site and provides visual feedback to the user.

A fixed responsive navbar will be at the top of each page - it will contain links to other pages in the website and have a slightly contrasting color to the top section. This navbar will collapse on mobile devices - and justify centrally on the page.

Further research was conducted to understand how similar businesses present themselves on the internet, this information was used to aid my decisions when deciding the site layout, fonts, colors and general look and feel of the site.

I began to outline the content requirements for the site based on the research I had conducted and thought about the best way for a user to navigate through this content. Taking this approach I decided on seperate pages for content, linked together through a navbar and various call to action buttons throughout the site. The pages I decided to develop were: Home, Services, Gallery, About, Contact.

The home page, as a landing page for the site needed to contain clear content highlighting the key areas of the site a user may require. With this in mind, I would nest two buttons within the hero image, addressing the most popular two actions expected to be executed by users.

1. To view 'services'
2. To 'get a quote'

I began developing a wireframe design using Figma. 

I started with a single home page design, worked on developing a page structure which would support the requirements of the home page.

#### Home

The Homepage will feature three sections, on both desktop and tablet - all three sections will be visible without the need to scroll. The first section will contain a large photograph relevant the trade, overlayed by a bold business statement. It will also hold two call to action buttons, the first (OUR SERVICES) linking to the services page and the other (GET A QUOTE) linking to a pop-up contact form.
The second section will contain clear contact details for the business.
The third section will be divided vertically into two equal halfs. One part containing rotating testimonials, the other part informing the user of the business in some form.

#### Services

The Services page will consist of three sections. Again, on both desktop and tablet - all sections will be visible without the need to scroll. The first section will contain clear contact details for the business. The second section will contain a header - followed by a breakdown of the three services offered by the business, occupying an equal amount of the page each in a horizontal format. The third section is simply a page break followed by a call to action button guiding the user to - *GET A QUOTE*

#### Gallery

The Gallery page will consist of two sections. On desktop both sections will be visible without the need to scroll. Scrolling will be required on tablet and mobile view, but the images will reformat to ensure the best experience for the user. The first section will contain clear contact details for the business. The second section will contain a header - followed by six photographs of completed work. Each photo will be clickable to expand into a larger view. The third section is simply a page break followed by a call to action button guiding the user to - *GET A QUOTE*, which will open a pop-up contact form when clicked on by the user.

#### About

The About page will consist of four sections, no scrolling will be required to view all sections on desktop and tablet. The first section will contain clear contact details for the business. The second section will contain a header - followed by a short bio of the business tradesman on the left of the screen - directly to the right will be a stock image, which compliments the site. A short page break will be followed by the third section - containing the company values statements. This will display four key words, elegantly spaced and styled to acheive a bold and confident message to the viewer. The final section will be as is on both the *Gallery* & *Services* pages, with a call to action button for the user to - *GET A QUOTE*, which will open a pop-up contact form when clicked on by the user.

#### Contact

The Contact page will consist of two sections. The first section will consist of three elements. A section header, a contact information box and the contact form. On desktop views the contact information box will be justified left and the contact form to the right. On tablet and mobile, both will be centralised on the page, contact details followed by the contact form directly below. The second section will retail the same container space as used on the *About*, *Gallery* & *Services* pages, but in absence of the call to action button, as it is not required on this page.

### Responsive Design

Once all wireframes were developed for viewing in a browser at 1440 x 1024. I worked to create seperate wireframes for both tablet and mobile screen sizes. This required me to decide how best the content should be displayed on smaller devices. I ensured to keep the 'user' at the heart of any design choices. Making decisions on content order was important, as less content is viewable on smaller screen sizes without the need to scroll. To ensure engagement was maintained and users are able to find key content quickly, some content was shifted or even removed on smaller screens, using responsive design.

## Surface

### Colours

A palette of four colours were chosen for use accross the site. Each color compliments each other and the images used to display purpose to the business. The colours are able to be used to create contrast between each other and continuity between pages.

Color Palette - Three main obvious colors compliment the design of the site. These are displayed below:

- ![#b89f91](https://via.placeholder.com/15/b89f91/000000?text=+) `#b89f91` - Logo & Buttons
- ![#dca518](https://via.placeholder.com/15/dca518/000000?text=+) `#dca518` - Page breaks and footer
- ![#707070](https://via.placeholder.com/15/707070/000000?text=+) `#707070`- Page header

Various other shades of grey are used appropriately, to highlight, surround and drop shadows on elements to support the sign design and ease of navigation.

### Fonts

INSERT INFORMATION HERE, ONCE DECIDED ON FONT CHOICE

## Technologies

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.5.2) - with supporting JS Script and tooltips
4. Font Awesome (5.15.1)
5. MD Bootstrap (4.19.1) - with supporting JS Script
6. JQuery (3.5.1)

---

## Features

The site uses Bootstrap to create a collapsed navbar on small devices. This enables users to view more relevant content on smaller screens, with the option to expand the navbar if required.

The navbar also becomes fixed to the top of all pages if a user scrolls down to see more content. By doing this, the banner with the brand logo also dissapears. This is made possible by utilizing JavaScript technology.

A modal form is viewable upon clicking the 'get a quote' button on any page. Although not functioning as a form currently, for design purposes and to demonstrate the user journey it is linked to a response page. This provides feeback to the user, once data is submitted using the form. The same response page is linked to the contact form (viewable on contact.html page). The modal form was acheived by using supporting code from the MD Bootstrap library. https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/modals/forms/

An automated scrolling testimonal section is displayed on the home page. This is acheived using supporting code from the Bootstrap carousel component. https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/

### Future Features

I would like to add functionality for the business to be able to update their Gallery images, with current completed projects. This would need to be via an intuitive user friendly approach, with no knowledge of coding and would require other technologies not currently used in this project.

I would also like to add more functionality to the services page, enabling the user to click the images on the services page to view more images relating only to that specific service.

I also wish to animate the buttons used throughout the site, to provide visual feedback to users when they are interacting with button elements.

-----

## Changes In Functionality / Design

I have since decided to use a modal for the pop up form (Get a Quote) - it does not adopt the design from the wireframe above. 

It was decided that the 'get a quote' form was to be different from the contact us form. As they serve two different purposes.

Multiple Testimonials were added to the page - using a Bootstrap carousel - this will support user confidence in the business.
