### Design Choices

Further research was conducted to understand how similar businesses present themselves on the internet, this information was used to aid my decisions when deciding the site layout, fonts, colors and general look and feel of the site.

#### Colours

A palette of four colours were chosen for use accross the site. Each color compliments each other and the images used to display purpose to the business. The colours are able to be used to create contrast between each other and continuity between pages.

Color Palette (insert below) - 

colour 1
colour 2
colour 3
colour 4

#### Sections

I wanted the site to remain simple and easy to navigate, therefore the use of sections were kept to a minimum on each page. Most of the pages remain viewable in full without scrolling when using a desktop device. The reason for this design choice, is to acheive the purpose set out to make the user experience quick and easy to locate the information they require.

# Features

A fixed responsive navbar will be at the top of each page - which consists of two sections. 
1. The top section will contain logo, which will be justified (top left) apart from on mobile devices, where logo will rejustify to the center of the display.
2. The second section be be directly below, it will contain links to other pages in the website and have a slightly contrasting color to the top section. This navbar will collapse on mobile devices - and justify centrally on the page, below the business logo.

### Home

The Homepage will feature three sections, on both desktop and tablet - all three sections will be visible without the need to scroll. The first section will contain a large photograph relevant the trade, overlayed by a bold business statement. It will also hold two call to action buttons, the first (OUR SERVICES) linking to the services page and the other (GET A QUOTE) linking to a pop-up contact form.
The second section will contain clear contact details for the business.
The third section will be divided vertically into two equal halfs. One part containing rotating testimonials, the other part informing the user of the business in some form.

### Services

The Services page will consist of three sections. Again, on both desktop and tablet - all sections will be visible without the need to scroll. The first section will contain clear contact details for the business. The second section will contain a header - followed by a breakdown of the three services offered by the business, occupying an equal amount of the page each in a horizontal format. The third section is simply a page break followed by a call to action button guiding the user to - *GET A QUOTE*

### Gallery

The Gallery page will consist of two sections. On desktop both sections will be visible without the need to scroll. Scrolling will be required on tablet and mobile view, but the images will reformat to ensure the best experience for the user. The first section will contain clear contact details for the business. The second section will contain a header - followed by six photographs of completed work. Each photo will be clickable to expand into a larger view. The third section is simply a page break followed by a call to action button guiding the user to - *GET A QUOTE*, which will open a pop-up contact form when clicked on by the user.

### About

The About page will consist of four sections, no scrolling will be required to view all sections on desktop and tablet. The first section will contain clear contact details for the business. The second section will contain a header - followed by a short bio of the business tradesman on the left of the screen - directly to the right will be a stock image, which compliments the site. A short page break will be followed by the third section - containing the company values statements. This will display four key words, elegantly spaced and styled to acheive a bold and confident message to the viewer. The final section will be as is on both the *Gallery* & *Services* pages, with a call to action button for the user to - *GET A QUOTE*, which will open a pop-up contact form when clicked on by the user.

### Contact

The Contact page will consist of two sections. The first section will consist of three elements. A section header, a contact information box and the contact form. On desktop views the contact information box will be justified left and the contact form to the right. On tablet and mobile, both will be centralised on the page, contact details followed by the contact form directly below. The second section will retail the same container space as used on the *About*, *Gallery* & *Services* pages, but in absence of the call to action button, as it is not required on this page.
